	  <h4>Korgak, Half-Orc Warlock of the Fey</h4>
	  <p>Korgak left his tribe at a young age. During a trial, the Orc was separated from his tribe and lost in the wilderness. In his desperation, he made a plea to any who would listen. Help was offered by a great dark fey, the Mother of Ravens. She took him under her wing and granted him great power, though for this he was forever outcast from his tribe.</p>

		<h4>Torquan Woodheart, Wood Elf Druid</h4>
		<p>Torquan has walked the earth for centuries, tending to its trees and creatures of the forest. During the Great War with Zethyros the Mad Lich, however, her love was slain. Distraught, she retreated into the woods and found solace within the caves. While there, she discovered a strange tomb and a silver amulet bearing a red gem. She carries it with her now, not sure of its purpose but certain of its import.</p>

		<h4> Sickly Robin, Kenku Rogue</h4>
		<p>Robin was a petty thief and criminal from Balemyr. He found his home in Ashvale shortly before its destruction at the hands of the undead horde. He decided to return home with Simon and Korgak to gather what treasure he could. Sadly, however, the noble kenku met his end against a group of fiends from the abyss. He found solace in his final moments, leaving his ill-gotten gains to his newfound friends.</p>

		<h4> Simon Donegan, Dis-Born Tiefling Paladin of the Ancients</h4>
		<p>Simon was born cursed, the blood of Dispater lord of Dis flows through his veins. His family did their best to distance themselves from him, and he was to have no part of their business. He found himself a member of the Church of the Trinity, serving Heironeous as a valorous knight. He gives earnings from his adventure to his sister so that she may one day take up the mantle of the family business.</p>

		<h4>The Duelist, Warforged Rogue</h4>
		<p>The Duelist is a relic of a bygone age, one of the Mondhavian Soul Automotons crafted by the Dwarves and Gnomes to stand against Zethyros. Long dormant, he has forgotten much of his past, and is driven by the urge to fight with honor. He stands stalwart against all foes, hoping one day to find one worthy of his blade.</p>
