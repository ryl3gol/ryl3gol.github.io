  <p>This is one of the original maps of Delethon. Don't worry, I know how bad it looks. This was made in Campaign Cartographer 3, a program I recommend to anyone who can afford it and has use for it.</p>
  <p>This map is very important to the history of all my campaigns. With it, I established many of the core features of the world, such as:</p>
  <ul>
	<li>The basic geography of the setting</li>
	<li>The major kingdoms and their relations to one another</li>
	<li>The geographical and political history of the setting</li>
  </ul>
  <p>And all this just from one <a href="https://www.profantasy.com/products/cc3.asp">rough map</a> made in about an hour!</p>
